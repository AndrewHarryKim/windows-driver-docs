[Trace provider](trace-provider.md)

[Trace consumer](trace-consumer.md)

[Trace controller](trace-controller.md)

[Trace session](trace-session.md)

[NT Kernel Logger trace session](nt-kernel-logger-trace-session.md)

[Global Logger trace session](global-logger-trace-session.md)

[Trace Flags](trace-flags.md)

[Trace Level](trace-level.md)

[Control GUID](control-guid.md)

[Message GUID](message-guid.md)

[Control GUID File](control-guid-file.md)

[PDB Symbol Files](pdb-symbol-files.md)

[Trace Message Format File](trace-message-format-file.md)

[Trace Message Header File](trace-message-header-file.md)

[Trace Message Control File](trace-message-control-file.md)

[Registered Provider](registered-provider.md)
