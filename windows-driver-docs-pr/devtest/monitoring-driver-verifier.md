# Monitoring Driver Verifier


## <span id="ddk_monitoring_driver_verifier_tools"></span><span id="DDK_MONITORING_DRIVER_VERIFIER_TOOLS"></span>


The Verifier utility has several ways to monitor the actions of Driver Verifier and of the drivers being verified.

The kernel debugger extension **!verifier** can also be used to monitor and report on a number of statistics related to Driver Verifier's activities. When verifying graphics drivers, the **!gdikdx.verifier** extension should be used instead. For information about debugger extensions, see [Windows Debugging](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551063).
