    -   **Package Name**
    -   **Publisher**
    -   **App ID**
    -   **Verb**
    -   **AutoPlay Type**
        -   From the list, select **Device** or **Content**.
-   To define an AutoPlay Handler for a desktop app, fill out the fields under **Desktop AutoPlay Handler**.
    **Note**  You can't define both AutoPlay Handler and Desktop AutoPlay Handler.
