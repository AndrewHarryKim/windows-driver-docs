# Ungrouping Trace Sessions


To ungroup a trace session group:

1.  [Stop all running trace sessions](stopping-a-trace-session.md) in the group.

2.  In the [Trace Session List](trace-session-list.md), right-click any cell in a grouped session.

3.  Click **Ungroup Session**.

When you ungroup stopped trace sessions, they start running again. To remove the trace sessions, stop them, and then [remove them](removing-a-trace-session.md).
