# Saving a Filter


There is no specific procedure to save a filter. Instead, you can save the trace session in a workspace. The filter is saved as part of the workspace. To save a workspace:

1.  In the [Trace Session List](trace-session-list.md), right-click any cell in the session, and then click **Save Workspace**.

2.  At the bottom of the page, in the **Workspace** box, type a name for the workspace, and click **OK**.

When saving the filter in a workspace, be careful not to overwrite files that you want to save. Because the path and file name of the trace log are saved in the workspace, if you open a workspace, the existing trace log file is overwritten. For more information, see [Using TraceView Workspaces](using-traceview-workspaces.md).
