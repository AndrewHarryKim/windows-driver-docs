# What is an autologger?


An *autologger* is a [trace session](trace-session.md) that records events from user-mode and kernel-mode [trace providers](trace-provider.md) during the boot process. This feature lets you trace the actions of a trace provider while Windows is booting.

Autologger sessions are supported only on Windows Vista and later versions of Windows. On these systems, you can log to a Global Logger trace session, as described in [Tracing During Boot](tracing-during-boot.md), but autologgers are the preferred method.

For more information about autologgers and methods of boot tracing in prior versions of Windows, see [Tracing During Boot](tracing-during-boot.md).
