# Using the Tracing Flags and Level Selection dialog box


In the **Tracing Flags and Level Selection** dialog box, the **G** (GUID) icon represents a trace provider. This icon appears beside the file name of the [trace message control (.tmc) file](trace-message-control-file.md) for the trace provider. To select the trace level and trace flags for a provider, locate the appropriate **G** icon and do the following:

-   To display or change the trace level of a provider, do one of the following:
    -   Double-click the **Level** item for the provider, and then select the level that you want for the provider. (You can select only one level.)
    -   Right-click the **Level** item, point to **Level**, and then click the level that you want for the provider.
-   To display or change the flags of a provider, do one of the following:
    -   Double-click the **Flags** item for the provider, and then select or clear the check box for the flag that you want. (You can select multiple flags).
    -   Right-click the **Flags** item, and then click **Set All Flags** or **Clear All Flags**.
-   To save the changes, click **OK**.
