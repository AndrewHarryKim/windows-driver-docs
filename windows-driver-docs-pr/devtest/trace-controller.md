# Trace Controller


*Trace controllers* are the applications and tools that manage trace sessions. Trace controllers enable [trace providers](trace-provider.md); configure, start, and stop [trace sessions](trace-session.md); and query and update the properties of trace sessions.

[Tracelog](tracelog.md) is a trace controller. [TraceView](traceview.md) is both a trace controller and a [trace consumer](trace-consumer.md).
