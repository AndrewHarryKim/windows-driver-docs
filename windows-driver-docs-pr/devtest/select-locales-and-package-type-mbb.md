# Select locales and package type in the Mobile Broadband Metadata Authoring Wizard


Select the appropriate locale or locales of your metadata package, as well as your package type (Windows 7 or Windows 8).

To do this, follow these steps:

1.  Click the **Package Definition** tab.
2.  Under **Available locales**, select the ones that you want to associate to the metadata package.
    **Note**  This step is required for all metadata packages.

     

3.  Under **Locale Default**, do one of the following:
    -   If you want the package to appear in a specific language when a package isn't available for a locale, select the desired language.
        **Note**  Only one metadata package can be specified as the Local Default package.

         

    -   If you don't want the package to appear in a specific language when a locale-specific package isn't available, select **No default**.
