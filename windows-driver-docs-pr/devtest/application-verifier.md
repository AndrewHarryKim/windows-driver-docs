# Application Verifier


Application Verifier (AppVerif.exe) is a *dynamic verification* tool for user-mode applications. This tool monitors application actions while the application runs, subjects the application to a variety of stresses and tests, and generates a report about potential errors in application execution or design.

Application Verifier can detect errors in any user-mode applications that are not based on managed code, including user-mode drivers. It finds subtle programming errors that might be difficult to detect during standard application testing or driver testing.

You can use Application Verifier alone or in conjunction with a user-mode debugger. This tool runs on Microsoft Windows XP and later versions of Windows. The current user must be a member of the Administrators group on the computer.

Application Verifier is included in the [Windows Software Development Kit]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=309790) (SDK) for desktop apps and is available as a separate downloadable component when you download the SDK from [Downloads for developing desktop apps]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=309790). The tool comes with its own documentation. To read the documentation, start Application Verifier and from the **Help** menu, click **Help**, or press F1.
