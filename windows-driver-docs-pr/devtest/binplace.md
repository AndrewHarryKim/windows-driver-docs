BinPlace is a tool for managing large code projects. It can move executable files, symbol files, and any other type of file. It can also extract symbols from an executable file and can remove private symbols from a symbol file.

BinPlace is useful if you are building a large number of modules and delivering them in a variety of packages. If you do not have a large project, you will still find BinPlace useful for manipulating symbol files.
