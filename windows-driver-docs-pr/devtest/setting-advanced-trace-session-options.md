# Setting Advanced Trace Session Options


## <span id="ddk_setting_advanced_trace_session_options_tools"></span><span id="DDK_SETTING_ADVANCED_TRACE_SESSION_OPTIONS_TOOLS"></span>


TraceView's advanced trace session options set the properties of the trace session and trace providers. You set advanced options while creating a trace session.

This section includes:

[How to set advanced trace session options](how-to-set-advanced-trace-session-options.md)

[Output File Options](output-file-options.md)

[Log Session Parameter Options](log-session-parameter-options.md)

For information about setting these properties in a [trace controller](trace-controller.md), see the description of the **EVENT\_TRACE\_PROPERTIES** structure in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation.

The default values that TraceView sets might differ from the default values set by other trace controllers, such as [Tracelog](tracelog.md).
