# Where are the tracing tools?


In the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) 8.1, many of the tracing tools, such as [Tracefmt](tracefmt.md) and [Tracelog](tracelog.md), are located in the %WindowsSdkDir%\\bin\\*platform* directory. Where %WindowsSdkDir% is the directory where the WDK and SDK are installed, and *platform* is either x64 or x86. Other tracing tools, such as Logman.exe, are included with the Windows operating system.

[TraceView](traceview.md) is located in the %WindowsSdkDir%\\Tools\\*platform* directory.

For a complete list of the tracing tools and their locations, see [Survey of Software Tracing Tools](survey-of-software-tracing-tools.md) and the [Index of Windows Driver Kit Tools](index-of-windows-driver-kit-tools.md).
