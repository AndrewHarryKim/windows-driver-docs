1.  Click the **Icon** tab.
2.  Do one of the following:

    -   If you have an icon for your device, drop the file from your computer onto the black **Drop Device Icon Here** area. Or, you can click **Browse** and select the icon file.
        **Note**  If you're running the device metadata authoring tool as an administrator, you must use the **Browse** button to select the icon file.

         

    -   If you don't have an icon of your own, click **Next**. Windows assigns a generic icon based on the primary category that you specify in the **Categories** tab.
