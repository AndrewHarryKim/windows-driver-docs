# Color Coding in the Trace Tree Pane


SDV uses colors to help you quickly interpret what you see.

-   **Black text with a yellow highlight** indicates driver code.

-   **Black text with no highlight** indicates the first call into the driver and the call to return from the driver.

-   **Grey text** indicates SDV code.

-   **Blue highlight** indicates the **Trace Tree** pane element that is associated with a line of code that is selected in the **Source Code** pane. The blue highlight appears only when a line of code is selected in the **Source Code** pane.
