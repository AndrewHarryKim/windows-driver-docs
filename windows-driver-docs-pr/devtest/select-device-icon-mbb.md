-   48 x 48: 4-bit 16 color

2.  Specify an icon for Windows Connection Manager.

    -   Drop the icon file from your computer onto the black **Drop Service Icon Here** area. Or, click **Browse** and select the icon file.
        **Note**  If you're running the device metadata authoring tool as an administrator, you must use the **Browse** button to select the icon file.
