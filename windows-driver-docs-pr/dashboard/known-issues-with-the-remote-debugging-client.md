Although there is an option on the **Sign in** page to select “Sign in automatically”, you must still enter your Dashboard credentials each time you start the Windows Remote Debugging client.

The Windows Remote Debugging client requires Windows Essentials to initiate the Microsoft account sign-in, and will install it if you don't have it on your computer. However, if you have already installed Windows Essentials, don't uninstall it.

If you have already uninstalled Windows Essentials, reinstall it before you install the Windows Remote Debugging client.
