# Manage Driver Distribution in Windows 8.1 and earlier


You can manage the distribution settings for pre-Windows 10 operating systems using this UI.

If your submission also contains drivers for Windows 10, you must manage the Windows 10 settings using the [new interface](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt181352.aspx).
