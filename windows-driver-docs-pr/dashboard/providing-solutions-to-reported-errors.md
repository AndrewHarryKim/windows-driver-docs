# Providing Solutions to Reported Errors


When a user chooses to submit an error report, Microsoft Windows Error Reporting (WER) determines whether a solution has been associated with that category of error. If a solution exists, the user will see a response in Windows Action Center.

After you have analyzed your company's error reports and created fixes or other solutions, you can create a message to be delivered through WER to customers who experience that issue in the future. By taking advantage of the WER feedback loop, you can provide information to your customers to help solve their problems and to reduce your company's support costs.
