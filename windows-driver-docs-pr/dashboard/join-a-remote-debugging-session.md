# Join a Remote Debugging Session


Applies To: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8

With the Windows Remote Debugging (Windows RD) client, you can accept an invitation to join a remote debug session from any computer with Internet connectivity that has the Windows RD client installed. You don't need to be connected to your corporate network, and you don't need to have the debugger package installed on your computer.

To be invited to join a session, you must be an eligible client. For more information, see [Prepare for Remote Debugging](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/br230785.aspx).

**To join a remote debugging session**

1.  Sign in to the Windows RD client with the Microsoft account that you use to sign in to the dashboard from either the Hardware Dev Center or the Windows Dev Center.

2.  On the **Client Sessions** tab, double-click the session to which you have been invited.

3.  The **Command** window for the session opens, showing the debugging history.

As an invited client, you can join a session from multiple computers, but only from one computer at a time.
