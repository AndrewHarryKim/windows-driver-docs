# App Certification Submissions


Windows certification can help customers make better purchasing decisions by identifying products that have passed Microsoft-designed tests for compatibility and reliability.

To get your app certified, start by reviewing the [Windows 8.1 App Certification Program Requirements](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=219249). Then develop and test your software by using the [the Windows App Certification Kit](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=219252). Finally, submit it for certification through the dashboard.

**Note**  
Before you can make a submission, your company must purchase a Microsoft Authenticode Certificate from VeriSign or DigiCert and create a dashboard account. For more information, see [Get Started](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/br230779.aspx).
