# Get started with the Hardware program


It's easy to get started with the Windows Hardware Dev Center program.

## <span id="Register_for_the_Hardware_Program"></span><span id="register_for_the_hardware_program"></span><span id="REGISTER_FOR_THE_HARDWARE_PROGRAM"></span>Register for the Hardware Program


Your company's administrator must [register](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=828002) for the Windows Hardware Dev Center program. See [Register for the Hardware Program](register-for-the-hardware-program.md) for additional information about the registration process.

You can help your customers identify quality products that run reliably on Windows-based computers by testing your products and participating in the Windows Hardware Compatibility Program (for Windows 10), or the Windows Hardware Certification Program (for Windows 8/8.1 and older operating systems).

These programs enable you to design, create, and test your hardware and drivers before you submit the final version through the Windows Hardware Dev Center dashboard. For more information, see the [Windows hardware certification](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=224782) page.

## <span id="Submit_your_hardware_and_drivers_for_the_compatibility_program_or_certification"></span><span id="submit_your_hardware_and_drivers_for_the_compatibility_program_or_certification"></span><span id="SUBMIT_YOUR_HARDWARE_AND_DRIVERS_FOR_THE_COMPATIBILITY_PROGRAM_OR_CERTIFICATION"></span>Submit your hardware and drivers for the compatibility program or certification


-   First, take a look at [Hardware certification submissions](hardware-certification-submissions.md). This section explains how to [create a new hardware submission](create-a-new-hardware-submission.md) and [manage hardware submissions](manage-your-hardware-submissions.md).

-   For information about attestation signing your drivers on the Sysdev dashboard, see [Attestation signing a kernel driver for public release](attestation-signing-a-kernel-driver-for-public-release.md).

-   After your product passes the review, it becomes eligible for the hardware compatibility or certification program. In addition, you can publish it to the [Windows Server Catalog](https://www.windowsservercatalog.com/ ) and the [Windows Certified Products List](windows-certified-products-list.md) by providing an announcement date in your submission.

-   If you have drivers that you want to distribute with Windows Update or share with another company, see the [Manage driver distribution with shipping labels](manage-driver-distribution-by-submission.md) section. This section covers common driver distribution tasks such as:

    -   [Publish a driver to Windows Update](publish-a-driver-to-windows-update.md)
    -   [Share a driver with a partner](sharing-drivers-with-your-partners.md)
    -   [Publish a shared driver to Windows Update](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt786464)
    -   [Publish a driver on behalf of a partner](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt786462)
    -   [Expire a driver from Windows Update](expire-a-driver-from-windows-update.md)
    -   [View partner shipping labels for a shared driver](viewing-shipping-labels-for-your-shared-driver.md)
