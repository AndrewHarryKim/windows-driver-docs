# Bug Management


Use this feature to submit bugs against Microsoft®, and receive bugs posted by Microsoft against your devices during the development of new versions of Windows®.

To use the bug management feature, you and your company must be registered with the Dashboard, and you must have permissions to manage bugs. This feature is only available if your company has been on-boarded through the Windows ecosystem on-boarding program.

**Note**  
You can sign in to the Dashboard from either the Windows Dev Center or the Hardware Dev Center. Use the Microsoft account associated with the Dashboard. The Dashboard replaces Winqual (Windows Quality Online Services).

 

For more information about registering your company, signing in, and updating your permissions for the Dashboard, see the following topics:
