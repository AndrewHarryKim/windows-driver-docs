# Create Responses


When you see that your users are experiencing problems with your products, you can create a response to explain the cause and offer a real-time solution, such as a link to a fix that the user can download. Once you’ve created a response for a specific problem, customers who then experience the crash (and choose to share crash data with Microsoft) will receive the response in Action Center (Windows 7 and above) or Problem Reports and Solutions (Vista).

Responses enable you to respond to your users at the time of incident, and can help lower your support costs.

Responses are available in the following languages:

-   Chinese Traditional

-   Chinese Simplified

-   Dutch

-   English

-   French

-   German

-   Japanese

-   Korean

-   Spanish
