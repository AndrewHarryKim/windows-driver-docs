# Test-Sign Your Driver (Legacy)


Before submitting a package for certification, you can either test-sign it yourself by using the [SignTool tool](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=238330), or you can use the Hardware Dev Center dashboard to test-sign the catalog (.cat) files.

1.  Create a cabinet (**.cab**) file containing the .cat files you want to test-sign.

2.  Sign in to the dashboard with your Microsoft account.

3.  On the left side of the window, click **File signing services**, and then in the **Test-sign (legacy)** tile, click **Create legacy test-sign submission**.

4.  Browse to the .cab file you created, and then click **Upload**.

Your **.cab** file will be included in the **Legacy test-sign requests** list. You can download the signed .cab file when the status has changed to **Succeeded**.
