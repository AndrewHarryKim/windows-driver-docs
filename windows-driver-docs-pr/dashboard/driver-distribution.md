# Driver Distribution


After you have completed a driver submission, use the **Driver Distribution Center** to review and modify your driver distribution settings for Windows Update:

-   Sign in to the dashboard with your Microsoft account, and then on the left side of the page, click **Driver distribution**.
-   You will be presented with two options:
    -   Manage Windows 10 and above
        -   If your submission contains drivers for Windows 10 and above Operating systems this is where you can manage the distribution settings for your driver using one of the two tabs:
            -   [Manage driver distribution by submissions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt181351.aspx)
            -   [Manage driver distribution by devices](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt181350.aspx)
    -   Manage Windows 8.1 and below
        -   If your submission contains drivers for Windows 8.1 and below Operating systems this is where you can manage the distribution settings for your driver using one of the three tabs:

            -   [Devices Without Drivers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/br230802.aspx)
            -   [Driver Statistics](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/br230762.aspx)
            -   [Add or Remove Drivers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/br230805.aspx)

            After you click one of these tabs, you can filter the data by using the results filter, or enter the submission ID for a specific submission. For more information, see [Filter and Search Your Submissions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/br230792.aspx)

To align with the new Windows as a Service philosophy, users will routinely receive OS updates. These updates will fix bugs and issues but also light up new features and enable new scenarios. Because of this, Windows 10 will be an ever-evolving OS.

For Windows 10, the end-to-end Windows driver publishing and distribution workflow has been modified to accommodate these changes.

You can download the Windows 10 Driver Publishing Workflow document using the link below. The document outlines the goals, scenarios, and requirements that enable the end-to-end driver publishing workflows which will enable Upgrade/Update Customer Satisfaction.
